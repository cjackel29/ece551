The ECE 551 repository is a collection of files for the Machine Learning Problems course at University of New Mexico.
The data are versions of satellite telemetry from Shawn Polson's repository https://github.com/sapols/Satellite-Telemetry-Anomaly-Detection/tree/master/Metadata
Most of the Jupyter notebooks are modified versions of Vijay's autoencoder tutorial at https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_anomaly_detection/ 
that use Polson's bus voltage telemetry.
